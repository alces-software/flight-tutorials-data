  steps:
    hello:
      title: Say hello to the world

        You should type this:

        ```
        echo "Hello, world."
        ```

        I shall reward you with a pegamoose. I promise.

      # The list of matches for this step.
      #
      # A match consists of an inputLine, anchored and regexp flags and a
      # nextStep.
      #
      # `inputLine` is the string that will be tested against the input provided
      # by the user.
      #
      # `anchored` is either a boolean or an object with `start` and `end`
      # boolean attributes.  A value of `true` is equivalent to `{start: true,
      # end: true}` and a value of `false` is equivalent to `{start: false,
      # end: false}`.  If `start` is true, `inputLine` will only match if it
      # is the first non-white space that the user enters.  Similarly for
      # `end`.
      #
      # `regexp` is a boolean.  If true, `inputLine` will be treated as a
      # regular expression, otherwise, it will be tested as a fixed string,
      # requiring an exact match.
      #
      # `nextStep` is the identifier of the step to progress to if the
      # inputLine matches.
      #
      # Each match will be tested in order.
      matches:
        - inputLine: echo "Hello, world."
          anchored: true
          regexp: false
          nextStep: sinfo
        - inputLine: echo 'Hello, world.'
          anchored: true
          regexp: false
          nextStep: sinfo

    sinfo:
      title: Run a useful command

        WOW! LOOK! A PEGAMOOSE APPEARED!

        <p></p>

        Now try doing something useful, like, I dunno \`sinfo\`.

      matches:
        - inputLine: sinfo
          anchored: true
          regexp: false
          nextStep: complete

    complete:

        You're all done now. Goodbye!
